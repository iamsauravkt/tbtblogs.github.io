								<p style="line-height:20px;">My chemistry teacher once told me I'm "perfectly imperfect." And I couldn't agree more.<br><br>
I don’t have a 1600 on SAT or a 36 on ACT, I'm not a national athlete, I don’t know how to program a computer or write in iambic pentameter, and I can’t tell you the difference between a dactyl and an amphibrach. But that's okay.<br><br>
Because I’m not perfect and neither have I ever tried to be one. All I’ve been trying for years is to be the best and happiest version of myself—in 3 iterations. Here they are:<br><br>
Saurav 1.0: When Saurav was born, his parents had high hopes for him. They wanted him to be a geeky version of himself who kept topping every exam. And that's what they got: one who knew exactly how to excel in studies but failed miserably in social life.<br><br>
He would wake up early in the morning, study for hours before school, and then spend the rest of the day studying after school. His parents always emphasized that "you can't be a good doctor if you don't study enough", so he did just that. However, there was something missing in his life; he wanted to make friends, have fun and enjoy his time at school instead of being a nerd all the time. But whenever he tried to do something outside of his comfort zone (like going to parties), his parents would get angry and blame him for not being focused on his studies. They said that "a good student should never let anything distract them from their studies.”<br><br>
But then something magical: he was introduced to the internet!<br><br>
Saurav 2.0: It was an exciting time. Saurav 1.0 couldn't get enough of the internet. He started off by being obsessed with games and other distractions, but then he realized that there were so many things he could learn that would be both fun and rewarding. So, he started learning skills like transcription, web development, SMM, SEO, YouTubing and blogging—and eventually got his first paid job with all of these skills under his belt. Everyone was so proud of him. Hence was born Saurav 2.0.<br><br>
Saurav 2.0 is a social butterfly. He's got the personality of a puppy, but the experience of someone who's been around for decades. He's got the energy of an Olympic athlete and the enthusiasm of a toddler on his first day of school. He's everything you want in a friend—someone who will support you unconditionally, someone who will listen without judgment, someone who will laugh with you when something funny happens. He’s fun to be around: he can sing, play guitar, dance, and fight. He is what everyone else wanted Saurav to be and what they still do today: a light in their lives and a reason for joy and laughter. He's the version of myself that knows every day is a chance to learn something new, grow as a person, and make progress toward his goals. And he is my present self.<br><br>
Saurav 3.0: Saurav 3.0 is an incarnation of Saurav's aspirations, hopes, and dreams—a manifestation of all that he could be if he didn't have any limitations holding him back. It’s a shining example of what he can accomplish when he puts his mind to something. As his ideal future self, Saurav 3.0 serves as a source of inspiration for his everyday life.<br><br>
And that's my little-known imperfection—which makes me human. Cecil Pratt said it best: I'm not perfect, but I'm limited edition AND a work in progress.</p>

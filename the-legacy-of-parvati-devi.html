								<p style="line-height:20px;">My great great Grandmother, Parvati Devi, <br> Lived a life that was full of glee.<br>
Her spirit of courage and strength was seen,<br> In all of the lives she touched, it had been.<br><br>
Her legacy lives on in stories we tell,<br>
Of her courage and strength that we could not quell.<br> Her wisdom and words still ring true,<br>
In all of us, we know it too.<br><br>
She taught us to never give up in life,<br>
No matter how much trouble and strife. <br>With her courage and strength, we can succeed, <br>In taking on life's challenges with speed.<br><br>
She taught us to always stay true,<br>
No matter what life throws at you.<br> Her legacy of kindness and love,<br> Will never be forgotten, in heaven above.<br><br>
The legacy of Parvati Devi, a story of courage and strength,<br>
She fought against traditional social norms and superstition at length.<br> Her courage and strength was an example for all,<br>
To stand up and fight for what is true and be bold.<br><br>
She spoke up for the voiceless with a voice loud and clear, <br>Encouraging others to stand up and face their fears. <br>Though life brought many trials, she never wavered from her beliefs, <br>Confronting and challenging what the majority believes.<br><br>
Her courage and tenacity, still echo in the air,<br>
Her name remembered by many, her legacy still there.<br> Her courage and strength were a beacon of light, <br>That will never be forgotten, even in the darkest night.<br><br>
Parvati Devi walked through the village with her head held high,<br>
Dark skin that was once a curse had become a blessing for her to abide.<br> She faced the prejudices of her community, and stood up against them with glee, <br>Determined to make a change, and create a new history.<br><br>
She was one of the first to practice medicine in rural Nepal, <br>One of the first to challenge superstitions and witchesâ€™ tales.<br> Women in her community were treated with disdain and fear, <br>Forced to live apart from their families and shed many a tear.<br><br>
The cruelty of her village was dangerous and unfair,<br>
For if a family member fell ill or passed away, it was blamed on the witch-like woman who lived there.<br> Violence and hatred were then inflicted with no one to spare,<br>
The woman who was blamed, was the first to be thrown out in despair.<br><br>
But she was brave, and she refused to comply,<br>
She set out on a journey to challenge the status quo and defy.<br>
She fought against superstitions and against the beliefs of her community, <br>And slowly but surely, she began to make a difference for eternity.<br><br>
Parvati Devi had a mission, to bring about a change,<br>
To stand up to injustice and make her point to arrange. <br>She was a leader and a warrior, with a heart of gold, <br>Determined to fight for what was right, no matter how bold.<br><br>
Though her journey was hard and filled with strife,<br>
She never stopped believing in what she knew was right.<br> She traveled far and wide, and never got tired of the fight, <br>Her courage and strength was an example for all, day and night.<br><br>
Though many challenged her, she never gave up the fight,<br>
She stood her ground and faced her enemies with all her might. <br>Though her battles were hard, she never stopped believing,<br>
That justice and equality should be achieved, and that's how she was living.<br><br>
She showed us that standing up for what is right, <br>No matter the consequences, is the only way to go.<br> Her legacy will live on forever, in us it will flow.<br> The courage of Parvati Devi will inspire us,<br>
For generations to come, that is for sure.<br><br>
We honor her memory and her legacy too,<br>
With gratitude and love, we thank her for all she has done for us, so true.</p>

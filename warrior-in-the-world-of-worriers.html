								<p style="line-height:20px;">In a country where the government is rife with corruption and the wealthy are able to get away with whatever they want, it is up to us as individuals to take up the mantle of social justice and fight for equality.<br><br>

This means that we must be willing to stand up for what we believe in, even if it is not popular or safe. And we've seen this time and time again throughout the historyâ€”when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama; when Nelson Mandela was imprisoned for 27 years; when Susan B Anthony fought for suffrage for women in America. These heroes were brave enough to do what was right despite the consequences. And I believe that each of us has within ourselves the capacity for such bravery; all we need is an opportunity to be brave.<br><br>

If we want to see real change happen in our lifetimes, we need to make sure we're supporting each other in making those changes happen. We need to be there for each other when someone else's rights are being violated or when a person or group of people is being unfairly treated or discriminated against. This means standing up for them even if we're not directly involved in what happened or if we don't know them personally. By banding together and speaking out against injustice, we can make sure that everyone has access to resources like healthcare and education regardless of race or socioeconomic status; that everyone has access to clean drinking water; that no one is being forced into labor through human trafficking; and so much more!<br><br>

This is how I want to be different from what I am now, which is a human being who cares about equality, equity and social justice.</p>
